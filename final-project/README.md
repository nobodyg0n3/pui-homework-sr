# **FP1 \- Proposal for Critique**

## Idea Sketches

### *Idea 1*

**Main goal:**  
The goal is to create a clean, smooth portfolio that balances minimalism with functionality. The primary focus is on accessibility—allowing users to navigate the site using just the keyboard while also offering interactive features like a live signature overlay on the profile picture.

**Interactivity and Engagement:**  
Interactive pieces, such as hover effects and subtle animations, will make the design more engaging. The homepage sketch emphasizes clarity with large text and visual hierarchy, while the live signature feature adds a personal touch.

**Accessibility:**  
Large-sized text will be used for readability, with a color scheme that prioritizes contrast (black and white with green accents) to assist users with visual impairments. Keyboard navigation and screen-reader compatibility will be incorporated to enhance usability for a wider audience.

**Concerns:**  
Ensuring the website is responsive and retains its usability on different screen sizes, especially for the homepage, remains a concern. Compatibility across different browsers could introduce complexity in terms of both design and functionality.


### *Idea 2*

**Main goal:**  
This portfolio focuses on presenting a fun yet professional image, highlighting a background in HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) and Information Systems (IS). The portfolio is intended to reflect creativity without compromising on professionalism.

**Interactivity and Engagement:**  
The portfolio sketches show a dynamic project section with potential timeline-based navigation for the project history. Interactive elements will include hover effects, with sections designed to captivate the user as they explore the content. Furthermore, blurred spheres that potentially move throughout the screen (or everything is blurred before scroll, allowing a gradient).

**Accessibility:**  
A key focus will be making the timeline navigation user-friendly for everyone, including those using assistive technologies. While keyboard navigation should work well overall, there may be concerns when distinguishing between scrolling through the timeline and selecting a specific project. To address this, I'll ensure that the timeline is navigable with clear visual cues and proper labels for screen readers. Additional accessibility features, such as clear text, well-contrasted colors, and intuitive navigation paths, will be implemented to create a seamless experience for all users.


**Concerns:**  
The primary concern is ensuring the timeline-based navigation on the project page is intuitive and easy to use. There may be potential issues with distinguishing between selecting a project and scrolling through the timeline, especially for users relying on keyboard navigation or assistive technologies. Another concern is making sure the overall navigation flows smoothly without overwhelming users with too many interactive elements, while still maintaining a professional and polished look.


### *Idea 3*

**Main goal:**  
This portfolio focuses on blending both software development and design skills into one cohesive platform. It has a modern-design feel as well as "more techy" aspects such as a typing animation on the home page. The goal is to allow users to explore both areas independently, yet in an integrated manner, through an interactive toggle system. This toggle will showcase the duality of my expertise without overwhelming the user, providing a clear distinction between technical and creative work while maintaining a unified aesthetic.

**Interactivity and Engagement:**  
The key interactive feature is the toggle between the software and design sections. This toggle will allow users to switch perspectives easily, engaging them with different facets of my work. Additional interactive elements, such as animated transitions and dynamic project displays, will help keep users engaged as they navigate through the portfolio.

**Accessibility:**  
Ensuring that the toggle functionality and all interactive features are fully accessible is a priority. The design will focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility, ensuring that users with disabilities can explore both the software and design sections effortlessly. Clear visual cues, intuitive navigation, and responsive design will help ensure accessibility across different devices and platforms.

**Concerns:**  
The biggest concern is maintaining a balance between functionality and complexity in the toggle feature. While the toggle provides an engaging experience, it must remain intuitive and not confuse users. Ensuring that the design is cohesive across both sections while highlighting their differences is also a challenge. There is a need to make transitions smooth and ensure all elements are easily accessible, especially for users relying on assistive technologies.

## Feedback Summary

During the lab session, my peers and instructors highlighted that merging Ideas 2 and 3 could create a more cohesive and impactful portfolio experience. They appreciated the distinct toggle between software and design work in Idea 2, which aligns well with my dual background in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Information Systems (IS). This feature offers an effective way to display both skill sets, providing a professional touch while maintaining a lively, engaging style. Integrating this toggle as a primary navigation element would strengthen my portfolio’s ability to cater to different viewer interests without overwhelming the design.

The floating resume page was also well-received for its interactivity and visual appeal, though feedback suggested it might be more beneficial to use the timeline feature here. By doing so, I could guide users through my career progression in a more narrative format, enhancing usability and clarity. While this feature is engaging, I understand that my portfolio must prioritize ease of navigation, so I'm rethinking its necessity and will consider a structured timeline approach to ensure users can easily access my experiences.

Accessibility was another key point, particularly regarding complex navigation on the project and timeline pages. My peers recommended focusing on making the experience intuitive rather than striving for complete accessibility perfection across every component from the outset. Rather than ensuring all aspects are immediately accessible in the same way, I can focus on getting continuous feedback to improve accessibility incrementally, balancing practicality with usability.

They also shared some ideas on color schemes that maintain strong contrast while adding vibrancy. My goal is to incorporate more color while still prioritizing legibility and readability, especially for those with visual impairments. Using teal, black, grey, and white is one potential direction that ensures enough contrast while giving the design a modern feel.


## Feedback Digestion

Reflecting on the feedback, my focus is now on merging Ideas 2 and 3 to create a well-rounded portfolio that showcases my HCI and IS background effectively. By keeping the toggle feature between software and design work, I can present both fields distinctly, supporting a dynamic user experience that’s professional yet engaging.

I’ve decided to approach the resume page based on a balance of simplicity and ambition. I found it challenging to get specific feedback on which resume format to choose, as my peers seemed indecisive and only responded when I asked direct questions. Given the limited guidance, I’ll aim for an MVP approach with a simple PDF hyperlink initially, which aligns with the standard setup on many portfolio sites. However, my goal is to develop this further into an animated resume with an option to download, offering an engaging yet practical overview of my experiences. This will be explored more throughout the development process and testing.

For the “About” page, I plan to expand beyond the typical image and brief intro commonly seen on other portfolios. This page offers an opportunity to provide a more comprehensive view of my background, particularly my leadership experiences. For instance, I can highlight my work in advancing CS Equity and accessibility, which led to a letter of recognition from Kamala Harris. The inclusion of such experiences will make the “About” page more meaningful, showing not only my skills but my commitments and the impact of my work.

Accessibility remains a critical focus, but I understand now that trying to make every element perfectly accessible immediately may not be feasible. Instead, I’ll focus on practical, high-impact improvements and continuously seek feedback to refine the design as I go. This will allow me to address the needs that most affect usability while balancing the ambition of my design. This makes me more confident in achieving a high quality combination of idea 2 and 3.

Finally, I’ll use more color while keeping contrast strong. A palette of teal, black, grey, and white achieves the modern, clean look I’m aiming for while ensuring readability and visual appeal. This feedback has clarified my approach to combining design elements with accessible, responsive, and interactive features, prioritizing both engagement and usability for a wide audience.
